# Motion Detection in Video

## Overview
This Python script is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate motion detection in videos. It utilizes the OpenCV library to process video frames and detect changes in them, indicating motion. The script is inspired by and builds upon the work shared by [Misbah4064 on GitHub](https://github.com/misbah4064/motion_detection) and a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zKfYOriFMM).

## Features
- **Motion Detection**: Detects moving objects in a video file.
- **Contour Analysis**: Identifies significant movements by analyzing contours in the video frames.
- **Customization**: Allows tweaking parameters like threshold values and contour area for different scenarios.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`cv2`)

## Usage
1. Install OpenCV if you haven't already: `pip install opencv-python`.
2. Set the `background` image to a frame representing the static background.
3. Specify the video file path in `cv2.VideoCapture`.
4. Run the script: `python motion_detection.py`.
5. Press 'q' to quit the video display.

## Understanding the Code
- **Background Subtraction**: The script compares each frame with a static background to detect changes.
- **Thresholding and Contour Detection**: It applies thresholding to highlight significant differences and uses contour detection to outline moving objects.
- **Parameter Tuning**: The threshold values and contour area can be adjusted to control sensitivity to motion.
- **Challenges**: Movement of clouds, trees, or small objects may trigger false positives. Adjusting parameters can help mitigate this.

## Future Enhancements
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Exploring automated ways to adjust sensitivity.
- **Human Feedback Integration**: Incorporating user input to refine detection accuracy.
