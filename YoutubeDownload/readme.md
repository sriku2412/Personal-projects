## Introduction
Hello! I'm a student who recently ran out of my YouTube Premium subscription. As a student, time is precious, and I need to learn efficiently and quickly. To overcome the challenge of distractions and ads on YouTube, I've created a custom solution. This tool is designed to download YouTube videos and playlists, allowing me to focus on learning without interruptions. While not a conventional method, it serves as an effective alternative to adblockers and helps in managing system resources better by avoiding browser usage during coding and watching sessions.

## Features
- **Download individual YouTube videos**: Given a URL, the script downloads the video to a specified location.
- **Download YouTube playlists**: Provide a playlist URL, and the script will download all videos in that playlist.
- **Automated topic-based downloads**: Input a topic, and the script fetches and downloads videos related to that topic.
- **Routine Learning**: Enables selecting at least three topics and a playlist for daily learning without distractions.

## How to Use
1. **Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed along with the `pytube` library. You can install `pytube` using `pip install pytube`.
2. **Configuration**: Modify the `output_path` in the script to your desired download location.
3. **Running the Script**:
   - For downloading a single video or a playlist, input the respective URL in the `ResearchTopics.txt` file.
   - For topic-based downloads, just type the topic in `ResearchTopics.txt`.
   - Run the script. It will process each line in `ResearchTopics.txt` and download accordingly.
